## Solutions to Computational Maths Problems

Solutions to the maths problems, inspired by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Each problem has associated tests that will be run on executing the script.

These are solutions based on archived problems that have been solved countless times.

Note that sharing code based on the current problems is against the competition rules, so if you try these yourself be mindful of this.
